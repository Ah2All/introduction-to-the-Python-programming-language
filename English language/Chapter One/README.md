## ðŸ”° What is programming?
> Programming is the process of writing code (text) to build software, programs, websites 
and mobile applications. In general, programmers use a programming language to create 
instructions for the computer to create a program (talk to the computer). These 
instructions may include mathematical calculations, data processing, file management, 
networking, and many other operations

</br>

## ðŸ’  High, low and intermediate programming language
- High, low and intermediate programming language :
These languages are designed to develop programs of varying complexity and are easy for 
programmers to understand and write. High-level languages are commonly used to 
develop web applications, desktop software, and computer games. For example: Java, 
Python, C#, JavaScript and PHP.

- Low-level programming language:
These languages are designed for more precise control and more productivity in computer 
systems. Low-level languages are directly compatible with computer hardware and 
architecture, and examples include machine languages and related languages such as 
assembly language.
- Low-level programming language:
These languages are placed between high-level and low-level languages and are usually 
used to translate code written in a high-level language into machine code. As an example, 
we can mention languages like C and C++, which are used in some cases to develop 
software with great complexity.

</br>

## ðŸ’  General purpose and special purpose languages
_Computer languages can be divided into two categories: general-purpose and special purpose (or specialized):_

- Multipurpose languages or General Purpose Language :
These languages are used to solve many problems and are used to program different types of programs, including applications, system, web, etc. In other words, general languages have the ability to solve various problems and they can be used for various applications. Some examples of 
common languages include Java, Python, C++, and C#.
But they are not great in all areas and maybe they are great in only one area


- Special Purpose Language:
 These languages are designed to solve specific and more limited problems and are mostly used in fields such as cognitive science, image 
processing, software engineering, website design, natural language processing, etc. In 
other words, specific languages are chosen for these applications because of their 
greater adjustability and more precise definition for specific problems. Some examples of 
specific languages include MATLAB, R, SQL, HTML, and CSS.
These languages can only be used in their specialized field

_In short, general languages are used to solve a wider variety of problems, while specialized 
languages are designed to solve more specific and limited problems._

</br>

## ðŸ’  Interpreted and compiler languages
_Programming languages are divided into two general categories: "compiler" and "interpreted languages"._

- Compiled languages, through a computer program called a compiler, convert the source 
code written in the programming language into executable code. When the compiler 
converts the source code into executable code, it fully interprets all the components of 
the programming language and looks for the instructions in the source code. Languages 
such as C, C++, Fortran, and Pascal are examples of translated languages.


- Interpreted languages execute the source code interpretatively (ie line by line) instead of 
converting it completely into executable code. In interpreted languages, a program is read 
line by line and each line is examined and executed immediately. Languages such as 
Python, Ruby, and JavaScript are examples of interpreted languages.

</br>

## ðŸ’  Static, dynamic, strong and weak typing languages :
_Programming languages are divided into four categories in terms of typing:_

- Static typing type:
In this type of programming language, the type of the variables is specified at compile 
time and the compiler checks before executing the code that any data type used 
corresponds to the type defined.
The main advantage of using this type of programming language is increasing reliability for 
large and complex programs.
Example: Java, C++, C#


- Dynamic Typing:
This type of writing, values and types of variables are checked at runtime instead of 
compilation. However, this type of programming language is very widespread in small and 
simple applications and is very widely used in programming languages such as Python.
Example: Python, Ruby, JavaScript

- Strong Typing:
In this type of programming language, we do not have any restrictions on accepting 
restrictions, changing the type of a variable is possible only when it is logically managed 
and usually requires that the variable be changed, but in other cases it is completely 
avoided.
Example: Java, C++, C#

- Weak Typing:
This type of writing is similar to the type of dynamic writing, with the difference that here 
the data type conversion is done with easy access and without checking the rules. After 
validating the data type, its type is automatically determined according to the type of operation.
Example: PHP, Perl, JavaScript.

</br>

## ðŸ’  Programming paradigms :
_Paradigm programming is an approach used to design and implement programs. These 
approaches include a set of rules and concepts that determine how programs should be 
written and how different programming practices should be implemented._
### The most common programming paradigms include
- Procedural
- Object-oriented
- functional
- Logic-based
- event-driven
- Security
- Web (Web-based)

_Each programming paradigm has its own advantages and disadvantages, and choosing a 
paradigm that suits your project needs can help improve program quality and reduce 
development costs._

## ðŸ’  The story of Python (History)
> Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that was 
designed by Guido van Rossum in 1989.
Initially, Guido was one of the developers who wrote a game in the Amoeba operating 
system using the C language. For some reasons, he came up with the idea of creating a 
high-level programming language that was better than C for programming. After trying 
several different names for this language, the name Python was finally chosen.
The first version of this language was released in 1990 and was constantly updated. In 1994, 
the second version of this language was released and was able to realize Guido's dreams 
about designing a high-level and object-oriented language.
In 2000, version 3 of the Python language was released with many improvements that 
significantly improved the object-oriented aspect of Python. In 2008, version 3.0 of the 
Python language was introduced with many safety and performance improvements.
Since then, Python has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the 
world, and many companies and developers use it. Python is an easy and powerful 
language that provides many features for developers and is currently recognized as one of 
the top programming languages in the world.

## ðŸ’  Applications of Python :
- Web development and web development frameworks such as Django, Flask and 
Pyramid
- Development of desktop applications and version control management tools such 
as Git
- Developing computer games and making video games with Python
- Development of mobile applications
- Photo and video analysis and signal processing
- Development of artificial intelligence programs such as chat bots, recommender 
systems, systems based on speech and text processing
- Digital marketing and SEO improvement
- Cyber security and penetration testing
- Scientific computing, numerical calculations and solving equations
- Development of IoT applications (Internet of Things)
- Development and construction of various monitoring systems and organization of 
networks and services.

</br>

## ðŸ’  What is the algorithm?

An algorithm is a sequence of well-defined steps that perform a specific task or solve a 
particular problem. In other words, it is a set of rules or instructions that a computer 
program follows to solve a problem. Algorithms are used in programming to automate 
processes, make decisions, and determine the most efficient ways of handling data.
A simple example of an algorithm is a recipe for baking a cake. The recipe lists all the 
necessary ingredients and defines the steps to be taken in a specific order to create the 
finished product. Similarly, in programming, an algorithm defines a set of steps that need 
to be executed in a specific order to achieve the desired outcome.

</br>

## ðŸ’  What is a flowchart?
A flowchart is a graphical representation of a process or algorithm. It uses symbols and 
diagrams to visualize the steps of a process, and the sequence in which they occur. 
Flowcharts are commonly used in computer programming, business processes, 
engineering, and other fields to identify, analyze, and improve processes.
In a flowchart, each step in the process is represented by a box or other geometric shape, 
and the flow of the process is indicated by arrows connecting the boxes. The boxes may 
contain specific instructions, calculations, or decisions, and the arrows represent the 
order in which they are performed.
Flowcharts help to simplify complex processes and make them easier to understand. They 
allow people to identify potential problems and bottlenecks in a process, and to develop 
more efficient or effective solutions. They can also be used to communicate processes to 
others and to document processes for reference purposes.

##🔹The topics we discuss in this chapter:

- Libraries in Python (The concept of script, module, package, library and framework)


## 💎The concept of script

#### 🔷 In Python, a script is a program written in the Python programming language that can be executed from a command line interface or from an integrated development environment (IDE).
A Python script is a file containing Python code, typically saved with a .py extension. When the script is executed, the Python interpreter reads the code and executes it line by line. Python scripts can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as automating repetitive tasks, processing data, or building complex applications.

## 💎The concept of module

#### 🔷 In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements, which can be used in other Python programs or modules. A module can be thought of as a library of reusable code that can be imported and used in other Python scripts.
A module in Python is typically saved with a .py extension and can include functions, classes, and variables. These definitions can be accessed by importing the module into another Python script using the "import" statement.

```python:
import math_functions
```

</br>

## 💎The concept of package

#### 🔷 In very simple language, a package in Python (Python Package) is a number of modules that are placed in a folder! Usually, the modules that are included in a package have a similar purpose. For example, the access level management part (authentication) of a program or user management can be a package.

</br>

## 💎The concept of library

#### 🔷 In programming, a library is a collection of pre-written code that can be reused by other programs. A library typically contains a set of functions, routines, classes, or modules that can be called by an application to perform specific tasks, such as file I/O, network communication, data manipulation, and more.
In Python, a library is typically packaged as a module or a set of modules that can be imported and used in a program.

</br>

## 💎The concept of framework

#### 🔷 In Python, a framework is a collection of modules, libraries, and tools designed to help developers build applications more efficiently. A framework provides a set of conventions, best practices, and reusable code that can be used to simplify the development process and speed up the time-to-market of the application.
Frameworks typically provide a foundation for building web applications, desktop applications, games, or other types of software. Some popular Python frameworks include Django, Flask, Pyramid, and CherryPy, among others. These frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries that help developers handle common tasks such as routing, database access, templating, security, and more.

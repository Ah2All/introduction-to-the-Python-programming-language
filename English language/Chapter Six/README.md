## ðŸ’ŽThe concept of script

#### ðŸ”· In Python, a script is a program written in the Python programming language that can be executed from a command line interface or from an integrated development environment (IDE).
A Python script is a file containing Python code, typically saved with a .py extension. When the script is executed, the Python interpreter reads the code and executes it line by line. Python scripts can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as automating repetitive tasks, processing data, or building complex applications.


## ðŸ’ŽThe concept of module

#### ðŸ”· In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements, which can be used in other Python programs or modules. A module can be thought of as a library of reusable code that can be imported and used in other Python scripts.
A module in Python is typically saved with a .py extension and can include functions, classes, and variables. These definitions can be accessed by importing the module into another Python script using the "import" statement.

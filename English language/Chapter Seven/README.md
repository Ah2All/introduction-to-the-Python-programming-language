## ðŸ’ŽWhat Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?

#### ðŸ’¢ Concept Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm in which programs are designed and implemented as collections of objects. Each object has specific properties and behaviors that are defined as methods. By using object-oriented programming, you can design programs that are modular and extensible. In other words, by using objects and their relationships, you can design programs that are easily adaptable and changeable in the future.For example, suppose you want to design a program for managing a library. In object-oriented programming, a library object is defined with properties such as a name, address, opening and closing times, and behaviors such as adding books, deleting books, and searching for books. Similarly, a book object is defined with properties such as a name, author, and publication year, and behaviors such as displaying book information and editing book information. Then, using these objects, you can design your library program.

#### ðŸ’¢ Object-Oriented Programming in python
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

For instance, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.

Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.

Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming, which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow sequentially in order to complete a task.

The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.

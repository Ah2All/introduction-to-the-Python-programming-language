## ðŸ’ŽWhat Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm in which programs are designed and implemented as collections of objects. Each object has specific properties and behaviors that are defined as methods. By using object-oriented programming, you can design programs that are modular and extensible. In other words, by using objects and their relationships, you can design programs that are easily adaptable and changeable in the future.For example, suppose you want to design a program for managing a library. In object-oriented programming, a library object is defined with properties such as a name, address, opening and closing times, and behaviors such as adding books, deleting books, and searching for books. Similarly, a book object is defined with properties such as a name, author, and publication year, and behaviors such as displaying book information and editing book information. Then, using these objects, you can design your library program.

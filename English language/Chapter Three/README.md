## 💎Concept of Variable
> In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value. It is used to store and manipulate data. When you create a variable in Python, you must choose a name for it, assign it a value, and declare its data type (although in most cases, Python automatically detects the data type based on the assigned value).

**⭕️ It is like a container into which we pour something and then use it**

### 🔻How to define a variable in Python🔻
To define a variable in Python, we first specify the variable name and then use the equal sign (=) to assign the desired value to the variable. For example:

```python:
name = "John"
age = 30
height = 1.75
```
In this example, three variables named name, age, and height are defined, and they point to the values "John", 30, and 1.75, respectively. These values can be strings, integers or floats, or even other data types.

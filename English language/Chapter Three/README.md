## üíéConcept of Variable
> In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value. It is used to store and manipulate data. When you create a variable in Python, you must choose a name for it, assign it a value, and declare its data type (although in most cases, Python automatically detects the data type based on the assigned value).

**‚≠ïÔ∏è It is like a container into which we pour something and then use it**

### üîªHow to define a variable in Pythonüîª
To define a variable in Python, we first specify the variable name and then use the equal sign (=) to assign the desired value to the variable. For example:

```python:
name = "John"
age = 30
height = 1.75
```
In this example, three variables named name, age, and height are defined, and they point to the values "John", 30, and 1.75, respectively. These values can be strings, integers or floats, or even other data types.

### ‚ô®Ô∏è Rules for Python variables:
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

For example:
```python:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```
Illegal variable names:
```python:
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
```

### üí¢ Python Variables - Assign Multiple Values
#### üîπMany Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
```python:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
#### üîπOne Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
```python:
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
### üí¢ Python - Output Variables
#### üîπOutput Variables
The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
```python:
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)
```
Output :
```python:
Python is awesome
```
In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
```python:
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)
```
Output :
```python:
Python is awesome
```
You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
```python:
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)
```
Output :
```python:
Python is awesome
```
**üõë Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome".**

For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
```python:
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
```
Output :
```python:
15
```
Example :
```python
name = "John"
message = "Hello, " + name + "!"
print(message) # Output: Hello, John!
```

## üíé Python Data Types
> In Python, a data type refers to the type of value that a variable holds. Python has several built-in data types including:

- Integers (int): Whole numbers without decimal points
- Floating-point numbers (float): Numbers with decimal points
- Strings (str): Ordered sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (single or double)
- Booleans (bool): True or False values used for logical operations
- Lists (list): Ordered, mutable collection of values enclosed in square brackets
- Tuples (tuple): Ordered, immutable collection of values enclosed in parentheses
- Sets (set): Unordered, mutable collection of unique values enclosed in curly braces
- Dictionaries (dict): Collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces with colons separating the keys and values.

**Data types are important because they determine the type of operations we can perform on a variable, how it behaves in certain situations, and how it is stored in memory.**

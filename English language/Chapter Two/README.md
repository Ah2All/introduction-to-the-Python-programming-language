# ðŸ’ŽConcept of IDE & Text Editor
> IDE and Text Editors are programs that developers use to write, edit, and manage programs and provide them with various features.
However, there are differences between the two, which we will discuss below

### **Concept IDE** =>
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE typically consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. It can also include features like version control integration, graphical user interface (GUI) builders, and many other tools that help simplify and automate the software development process.

### **Concept Text Editor** =>
- A text editor is a software application used for editing plain text files. Unlike an IDE, a text editor does not have any built-in features for compiling or debugging code. Text editors are used mainly by developers who prefer lightweight, customizable tools for writing code. Some popular text editors include Atom, Sublime Text, and Visual Studio Code.

##### While both IDEs and text editors can be used for writing code, the main difference between them is that IDEs provide a more comprehensive set of tools designed specifically for software development, while text editors offer a more minimalistic approach with fewer built-in features. Ultimately, the choice between using an IDE or a text editor comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of the developer.

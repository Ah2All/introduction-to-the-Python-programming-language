# 💎Concept of IDE & Text Editor
> IDE and Text Editors are programs that developers use to write, edit, and manage programs and provide them with various features.
However, there are differences between the two, which we will discuss below

### **Concept IDE** =>
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE typically consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. It can also include features like version control integration, graphical user interface (GUI) builders, and many other tools that help simplify and automate the software development process.

### **Concept Text Editor** =>
- A text editor is a software application used for editing plain text files. Unlike an IDE, a text editor does not have any built-in features for compiling or debugging code. Text editors are used mainly by developers who prefer lightweight, customizable tools for writing code. Some popular text editors include Atom, Sublime Text, and Visual Studio Code.

##### 🔹While both IDEs and text editors can be used for writing code, the main difference between them is that IDEs provide a more comprehensive set of tools designed specifically for software development, while text editors offer a more minimalistic approach with fewer built-in features. Ultimately, the choice between using an IDE or a text editor comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of the developer.

## 💢The difference between IDE and text editor

1. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is an integrated development environment that includes tools such as coding, debugging, compiling, and testing. These tools are automatically synchronized with each other and help programmers quickly build complex programs.

2. Text Editor is a program used for editing and writing programming code. These tools typically only have text editing capabilities and do not have any other tools such as debuggers, compilers, and testers.

3. IDEs are typically used for complex and large projects, while Text Editors are used for smaller and simpler projects.

4. IDEs have the ability to detect code errors and help programmers run the program better and faster, while Text Editors do not have this capability.

5. IDEs are usually designed for specific programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python, while Text Editors can be used for all programming languages.
